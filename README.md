### About Stackbit

[Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/) enables features like inline content editing, live previews and collaboration tools for Jamstack sites.

## Working with This Theme

This theme is written in Unibit. Themes written in Unibit can be converted to other static sites generators (SSG) such as Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll and Next.js using [Stackbit Site Builder](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/stackbit-themes/libris-unibit). The site builder will generate the SSG-specific version of this theme and push it to your own GitHub repository. You are free to use and modify the generated source however you wish.

### Editing This Theme

While we recommend using the [site builder](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/stackbit-themes/libris-unibit) to generate a version of the theme for any of the supported static site generators, you can develop locally using the Unibit CLI.  For details on how to install and use Unibit, visit the [documentation](https://docs.stackbit.com/site-builder/unibit/).

### Develop Using CodeSandbox

You can also develop this theme in the browser using Unibit via CodeSandbox.
